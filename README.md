This is the first lab for ITM 361 using HTML and associated tags to build my first website with brief introduction about me
I am also not sure if lab is due today or am I late. If so, I am sorry for the late submission as well if the deadline is before the 18th.. I have encountered the fatal error and have been trying to figure out how to properly use the GitHub desktop and was finally able to fix the issue with the help of an online forum.
